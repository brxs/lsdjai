//! The cpal device wrapper: a thin host around the device-free [`Engine`] core.
//!
//! Opens a stereo / f32 output stream with `BufferSize::Fixed(256)` and, in its
//! callback, sets FTZ/DAZ once and drains the engine's output ring(s) wrapped in
//! `assert_no_alloc`. The callback is the ONLY real-time path; it allocates
//! nothing, takes no lock, makes no syscall, and logs nothing. Ported from the
//! Spike A `rt_engine` device half (`spike/rust-audio/engine/src/bin/rt_engine.rs`),
//! now built on the library so the device path stays exercisable.
//!
//! The engine renders at exactly [`SAMPLE_RATE`] (48000). A device that offers a
//! 48000/f32 config is opened there and drained bit-exact (the fast path). A
//! device with NO 48000/f32 config — e.g. a 44100 Bluetooth speaker — is opened
//! at its own f32 rate and the 48 kHz stream is resampled to it on the callback
//! via [`OutputResampler`] (ADR-0029). All device-rate knowledge lives here; the
//! host's output ring stays a clean 48 kHz interleaved-stereo contract.
//!
//! Graceful no-device exit: if no output device or no usable f32 config is
//! available (likely in a sandbox / headless CI), [`run_stream`] returns
//! [`DeviceError::Unavailable`] rather than hanging or panicking.
